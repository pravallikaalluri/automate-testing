# Selenium Automation Project

## Overview
This project is designed for automation testing of web applications using Selenium WebDriver and Java. It provides a structured approach to writing and executing tests, ensuring that the application behaves as expected.

## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd selenium-automation
   ```

2. **Install Maven**
   Ensure that Maven is installed on your machine. You can download it from [Maven's official website](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi).

3. **Build the Project**
   Run the following command to build the project and download the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

4. **Run Tests**
   To execute the tests, use the following command:
   ```bash
   mvn test
   ```

## Usage Guidelines
- The `DriverFactory` class is responsible for initializing the WebDriver instance. You can specify the browser type in the `getDriver()` method.
- The `SampleTest`, `LoginTest`, and `SignupTest` classes contain test methods that utilize the WebDriver instance to interact with the web application.
- The `HomePage`, `LoginPage`, and `SignupPage` classes provide methods to interact with elements on their respective pages, making it easier to manage page-specific actions.

## Testing Framework
This project uses [JUnit/TestNG] as the testing framework. Ensure that you are familiar with the annotations and structure of the chosen framework to effectively write and manage your tests.
